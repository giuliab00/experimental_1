Assignment 1 of Experimental Robotics Laboratory
================================================

In this assignment we are given an environment where the robot start at the point (0,0) and 4 markers with a specific meaning are placed.
We are requested to reach all the markers by controlling the camera and the navigation of the robot. This must be done for either the simulation and the real robot.\
Here is explained in detail the behaviour for the simulation, while at the end of this document isd possible to finde the differences with the real robot implementation.
